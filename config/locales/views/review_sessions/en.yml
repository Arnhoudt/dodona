      explanation_part1_html: "In the summary table, you can click on the <i class='mdi mdi-chevron-right mdi-18'></i> icon next to an exercise. You will then be taken to an unreviewd submission of a random student.
      If you wish, you can leave feedback on the code and mark the submission as completed. Note that you can also mark a submission as completed without leaving feedback. To get started, we already marked all exercises without submissions as completed."

      explanation_title: "What is an evaluation?"
      explanation_html: "Evaluating a series is a structured way to give feedback on all submitted solutions of a series. Dodona keeps track of which submissions are already checked, so you can easily split work between multiple course administrators. The feedback you give isn't immediately visible for the students; you can decide when it is released."
