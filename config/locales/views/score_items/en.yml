        You can optionally grade the submissions in this evaluation from within Dodona.
        To do that, you'll first need to specify how you will grade the solutions.
        You can assign a number of score items to each exercise.
      explanation_part2: >
        You can assign score items per exercise below.
        Additionally, you can quickly add the same score item to each exercise.
        If you don't want to grade submissions, you can go directly to the evaluation.
        You can always change this later.
